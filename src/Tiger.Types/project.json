    "releaseNotes": "* Thanks to the magic of the .NET Standard, Tiger libraries are available to a wider set of platforms than ever before. The project now targets .NET Standard 1.0.\r\n* The `Either` static class has learned from `Option.None` and can indirectly create `Either` instances without specifying type parameters.\r\n* The main types of the library have had their struct layouts specified, leading to reduced memory usage when boxed.\r\n* LINQPad's custom dumping has been upgraded to the new method, leading to improved display and debugging.\r\n  * This and other improvements have led to a moderate reduction in the size of the library's assembly.\r\n* Debugger proxies have been attached to the main types of the library, vastly improving debugging.\r\n* Potentially confusing methods of creating `Option` instances have been removed.\r\n* Methods have been added that allow monadic operations to be performed through `Task`s.\r\n* A `Unit` type, a type with only one value, has been added.\r\n  * Some `void`-returning methods have been modified to return `Unit`. This value may safely be ignored.\r\n* `IEnumerable<T>` has learned a few monadic operations.",
